Knowledge is innate (rationalism).</li><li><strong>Aristotle:</strong> Believed knowledge comes from experience (empiricism). Wrote 'De Anima' (On the Soul).</li><li><strong>Hippocrates:</strong> Located mental functions in the brain, not the heart.</li></ul><h2>Medieval and Renaissance Period</h2><p>Psychology was largely subsumed under philosophy and theology. Descartes (17th century) renewed dualism with his mind-body distinction and the concept of reflex action.</p><h2>Enlightenment Philosophy</h2><ul><li><strong>John Locke:</strong> The mind is a 'blank slate' (tabula rasa), shaped by experience</li><li><strong>Immanuel Kant:</strong> Argued some knowledge structures are innate</li><li><strong>Associationism:</strong> Ideas connect through contiguity, similarity, and contrast</li></ul><p>These philosophical debates about nature vs. nurture continue today.</p>"

His approach, called <strong>Structuralism</strong>, used introspection to analyze conscious experience into its basic elements.</p><h2>William James (1842-1910)</h2><p>American philosopher and psychologist who founded <strong>Functionalism</strong>. Rather than asking what consciousness is made of, James asked what it does. His 'Principles of Psychology' (1890) remains influential.</p><h2>Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)</h2><p>Freud developed <strong>Psychoanalysis</strong>, emphasizing:</p><ul><li>The unconscious mind driving behavior</li><li>Childhood experiences shaping adult personality</li><li>Defense mechanisms (repression, projection, etc.)</li><li>The id, ego, and superego</li></ul><p>While many specifics are disputed, Freud's emphasis on the unconscious transformed psychology.</p>"

Key figures:</p><ul><li><strong>Ivan Pavlov:</strong> Discovered classical conditioning with his famous dog experiments</li><li><strong>B.F. Skinner:</strong> Developed operant conditioning (reinforcement and punishment)</li><li><strong>Edward Thorndike:</strong> Law of Effect - behaviors followed by satisfaction are strengthened</li></ul><h2>Behaviorist Principles</h2><p>Behaviorism dominated from ~1920-1960. It emphasized:</p><ul><li>Environmental determinism</li><li>The 'black box' approach (ignore internal mental states)</li><li>Rigorous experimental methods</li><li>Learning as the key to understanding behavior</li></ul><h2>Criticisms</h2><p>Behaviorism was criticized for ignoring cognition, being unable to explain language acquisition (Chomsky vs. Skinner), and oversimplifying human complexity.</p>"
